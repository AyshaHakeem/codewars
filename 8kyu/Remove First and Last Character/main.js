Description:
Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. You're given one parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters.
*/

// My solution
function removeChar(str){
    //You got this!
    return str.slice(1,str.length-1)
   };
