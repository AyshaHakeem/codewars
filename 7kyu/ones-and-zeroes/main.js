/*
DESCRIPTION:
Given an array of ones and zeroes, convert the equivalent binary value to an integer.

Eg: [0, 0, 0, 1] is treated as 0001 which is the binary representation of 1.

Examples:

Testing: [0, 0, 0, 1] ==> 1
Testing: [0, 0, 1, 0] ==> 2
*/

// My Solution
const binaryArrayToNumber = arr => {
    return parseInt(arr.join(''),2)
  };
